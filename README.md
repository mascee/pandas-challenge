###**PyCity Schools Analysis**

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- Pi City School district has 15 schools, and 39170 students.
- Although most schools are doing alright with math and reading, there are some distinct gaps. Especially if we compare both math and reading scores combined.
- Average Math score in the district is 78.98.
- Average Reading is 81.87.
- What is more important is to see how many students are passing English and Math together. The passing grade for students is determined as 70.
- We see that overall in the district the percentage of students that are getting passing grades in both English and Math is not that high, only 65.17%

**To see what schools are doing better we looked by the school type, school size, school budget and spending per student.**
  
**With schools compared by the size we see this picture:**

We see that overall passing rate is better (90%) in schools that are smaller then 2000 students.
Larger schools more then 2000 students have overall passing rate 58%


**Spending per student gave us these results:**

Spending budget per student tells us that grades are better in schools with less spending per student. In schools with spending less then $585 per student we see passing rate % 90, but in schools with more then $645 per student spending we see the passing rate 53%. 

We might want to look at the other data for more clear picture of the reasons for the education gap.

**School type comparison gave us these results:**

- We see that Charter schools are doing much better, with around 90% of students getting passing grades.
- Compared to the schools run by the District with the overall passing rate close to 53%.
  
  **With Charter schools are usually smaller and with less spending, we conclude that overall Charter schools are performing much better then the schools run by the district.**
